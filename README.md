Warehouse Property Tool

This is a simple Google Chrome extension we use on the data warehouse at the company I work for.
The following uses/functions are available:

1. Search - Searches listings either by address or property ID;
2. Exclude - Excludes currently included listings from being synced to 200;
3. Include - Includes currently excluded listings from being synced to 200;

Exclude and include functions will only be performed on unique listings.
